# Euclides Machine
-----------
## Synopsis
Euclid Machine is an abstract machine based on construction concept with compass 
and straigthedge and reveals non-computable functions unrelated to the halting problem. These functions help us understand the nature and purpose of non-computable functions more beyond the concept of a Turning Machine. 

## Overall Project Goals
Develope a software that is able to read and interpret files that contain instructions that are part of the 
language of Euclid Machine. The software is able to determinate if the file kept a lexical and syntactically correct structure and then graphically emulate each of these instructions following the logic of the turttle, which is implemented in multi-paradigm programming language Python.

## Motivation
The project began as an essential par of understanding the teory of computation.
